					Hi there! I’m passionate about using my skills to give back to the community. I enjoy working with Angular and find React to be a fun challenge. I
					love creating personal websites to support the Open Source community and build projects that make a difference. I pay close attention to UI details
					because I believe that sometimes, simplicity is key. 🤔

				<p>In my free time, I’m a big fan of Formula 1 🏎️ and love playing the guitar 🎸. I’d love to chat about F1, FRIENDS, or SPORTS!</p>
