		"My desire to work for any company is to give back to the community. I particular enjoy working with Angular, although React is another fun thing to play with. We have computers to make our work easier and exciting, so I try to use my skill to develop personal websites to help the Open Source community or create a fun website to wish on my friendâ€™s birthday. I practice my skills while trying to build these applications and looking forward to build many more which impacts the society.",
